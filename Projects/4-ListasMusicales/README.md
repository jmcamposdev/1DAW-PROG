# Listas Musicales (Swing)
Music Lists is a project developed for the Advanced Object-Oriented Programming course. The project is built using Swing and is implemented in Netbeans 17. 
It involves creating a music catalog management system where users can create and modify playlists of songs in various formats, such as M3U, PSL, and XSPF. 
The primary functionality of the application revolves around reading and writing song lists in different formats. The project focuses on teaching advanced OOP concepts 
like polymorphism, inheritance, interfaces, enumerations, comparators, and comparables.

# Functionality
- CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) performed on Songs 
- Read and export in 3 differents formats (M3U, PLS, XSPF)
- It uses shortcuts to perform operations such as: creating a playlist or a song, deleting a song, exporting and importing files, and others.
- Use of mnemonic shortcuts
- Some file format validations

# Project Structure
The ListasMusicales repository contains a PDF file that explains how to create the necessary classes with their respective attributes and methods to build the project. The project is divided into the following packages:
- `Datos`: It contains 3 example files of each format (M3U, PLS, XSPF) that you can import.
- `Img`: Contains the images used in the interface
- `Interfaz`: Contains all the Frame and JDialog for the interface to work.
- `Modelo`: Contains the classes and abstract JTable classes

# Conclusion
Conclusion `ListasMusicales` is a project to deepen the concepts about Swing and learn more about the development of interfaces, the use and modification of Swing elements and above all the work on CRUD file operations. Exception handling. This project has taught us the big difference between terminal and graphical interface development.
